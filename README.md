# Stark Tac Toe

Stark Tac Toe is a Tic Tac Toe game with the choice of pointing to an AI model backend for move decisions.
The AI model is uploaded with ML Village's platform service so that it can be tagged for ownership and issued for sales circulation if desired.

The ZK Machine Learning backend stack runs the inference and proof transaction receipts so that we can verify and validate ML inference via Stark proofs and ZK ML.
